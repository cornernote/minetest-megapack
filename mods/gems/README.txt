gems

Adds five gems which can be encrusted into your tools. Currently supports
moreores and default tools.

Added gems, from worst to best: garnet, aquamarine, topaz, diamond, opal.

Gems are encrusted by placing the gem and the tool into the crafting space.
A garnet-encrusted mese pick is worse than a topaz-encrusted gold pick.

A aquamarine-encrusted mithral axe is 10% faster and lasts 10% longer than a
normal mithral axe.

Steel, gold, and mithral are the only encrustable tools. Mese cannot benefit
from the effects of gems because it lacks the magical attunement to be
encrusted (or, in other words, balance).
