Changelog
---------

2012-08-01: Added optional recipes for items that use wool to also use cotton
instead.  Choose one or the other in any given recipe (you can't mix the two).
No, it isn't a Kosher thing. ;-)

2012-07-28: Noticed I technically had left/right textures swapped on a few 
blocks.  The textures were drawn to counteract this, without my realizing I was 
doing just that. :-) Fixed.  Also replaced all "tile_images" references with 
"tiles", since the former is deprecated in favor of the latter.

2012-07-26:  Updated to use the Vessels mod to give back empty dye bottles.

2012-07-24: Made all objects that use a dye require a more appropriate color, 
made all objects that use a dye give back empty bottles on craft, made grey 
shutters use the various grey paints directly.  Moved this changelog out of the 
forum post and into this separate file.

2012-07-12: Moved project to github.

2012-07-02: Deleted a few redundant files from the unified dyes mod.

2012-06-30: Added a fancy wood-and-glass door.  Textures used here were 
formerly used for (and have been replaced by new textures for) the default wood 
door in my realistic texture packs.

2012-06-27: Relaxed dependency on UnifiedDyes to prevent depending on Flowers.  
The mod will still use them if available; if not, you just can't craft the 
various colored objects.

2012-06-26: Separated dyes into their own mod ("unifieddyes").  Added a copy of 
flowers and made this mod depend on it and unified dyes.  Updated all crafting 
recipes to fit, got rid of the conditional code for flowers (since it is a 
dependency now), removed a bunch of redundant register_craftitem code, fixed 
some copy&paste errors on the window shutters.  As a consequence of these 
changes, white paint, titanium dioxide, and all colors of dyes will have to be 
removed and replaced (but the things that depend on them are fine).

2012-06-25: Removed all of the old legacy_wallmounted references - I didn't 
realize they were deprecated (and they were causing out-of-nodes issues also).

2012-06-23: Added small speaker, round brass pole, square wrought iron pole 
(without connecting rungs).  Fairly recent version of Minetest required for 
these to work (uses nodeboxes).  Note that if you've placed brass or wrought 
iron poles in your world already, they will be drawn using these newer styles; 
if you need the square poles and/or connecting rungs, you'll need to remove 
them and craft brass/wrought iron fences instead.

2012-06-16: Tweaked terracotta roof tiles/shingles to give the 4 pieces back on 
digging a 'shingle'.

2012-06-15 (a bit later): Did the same for the stereo and television and 
improved them in the process.

2012-06-15: Tweaked the speaker textures, added separate images for all 6 
sides.

2012-06-14: Added right-opening versions of oak and mahogany "folding" doors - 
allows one to create double doors.  Split the two colors into separate files.  
Inspired by Calinou's update to the default doors mod - works the same way too. 
:-)

2012-06-13 (a lot later): Changed the crafting recipe slightly for nightstands 
- they're designated as 'oak' now.  Added crafting recipe for mahogany 
variants.  If you've already placed nightstands into your world, you should 
remove them before updating - sorry, you'll have to rebuild them due my having 
had to change the node names.  Added initial crafting recipes for oak and 
mahogany drawers and complete dressers (dresser components are not yet useful, 
work in progress.  See crafts.lua for more details).

2012-06-13: Changed buckets of white paint so that the empty bucket is returned 
when the bucket of paint is crafted into something else (rather than when the 
bucket of paint is first created).  * Fixed copy&paste error from the previous 
bucket change.  * Moved smelting and crafting of white paint from crafts.lua 
over to dyes.lua.

2012-06-12: Multiple post-release updates over the course of the day. * Fixed 
recipe collision with glass panes.  * Implemented a full set of dyes derived 
from flowers, updated all related crafting recipes and screenshots to match. * 
Collected all dyes into one file.  Changed recipes for blue and purple dyes to 
something that makes a bit more sense. :-) * Tweaked oak shutters to give two 
pieces on crafting. * Added alternate recipes for orange and green dyes.

2012-06-12: Initial release.
